    "Language Modeling, to put it simply, <b>is the task of assigning probabilities to sequences of words</b>. This means that, given a context of one or a sequence of words in the language the model was trained on, the model should provide the next most probable words or sequence of words that follows from the given sequence of words in the sentence. Language Modeling is one of the most important tasks in Natural Language Processing.\n",

As you can see, this boils down to a sequential data analysis task -- you are given a word or a sequence of words (the input data), and, given the context (the state), you need to find out what is the next word (the prediction). This kind of analysis is very important for language-related tasks such as <b>Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Image Captioning, Text Correction</b> and many other very relevant problems. \n",

Basically, we will assign each word a randomly-initialized vector, and input those into the network to be processed. After a number of iterations, these vectors are expected to assume values that help the network to correctly predict what it needs to -- in our case, the probable next word in the sentence.

The traditional approach is to use one-hot encoding method that is usually used for converting categorical values to numerical values. However, One-hot encoded vectors are high-dimensional, sparse and in a big dataset, computationally inefficient. So, we use word2vec approach. It is, in fact, a layer in our LSTM network, where the word IDs will be represented as a dense representation before feeding to the LSTM. \n",
